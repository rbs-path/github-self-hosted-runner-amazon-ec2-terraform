- **Lambda Layer** with PyJWT and cryptography dependencies for optimized performance
- **Dead Letter Queue** for Lambda error handling
- **EFS file system** for shared runner workspace storage with optimized NFS parameters
- **CloudWatch log groups** for unified lifecycle logging with structured format
- **Secrets Manager** for secure GitHub App credentials storage
- **SSM Parameter Store** for NAT Gateway IP addresses

## Prerequisites

Before deploying this infrastructure, please ensure the following prerequisites are met:

### AWS Setup
- An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create and manage the resources included in this repository
- An OpenID Connect identity provider created in AWS IAM with a trust relationship to this GitHub repository ([detailed setup guide](https://skundunotes.com/2023/02/28/securely-integrate-aws-credentials-with-github-actions-using-openid-connect/))
- The ARN of the IAM Role stored as a GitHub secret for use in the `terraform.yml` workflow and referred via `${{ secrets.IAM_ROLE }}`.

### GitHub Setup
- A GitHub organization where the self-hosted runners will be registered
- A GitHub App created in the organization with the following permissions:
  - Repository permissions: `Actions (Read)`, `Administration (Read)`, `Metadata (Read)`
  - Organization permissions: `Self-hosted runners (Write)`
- GitHub App credentials (App ID, Installation ID, and Private Key) stored in AWS Secrets Manager

### Infracost Integration (Optional)
- An `INFRACOST_API_KEY` stored as a GitHub Actions secret for cost estimation
- A GitHub Actions variable `INFRACOST_SCAN_TYPE` set to either `hcl_code` or `tf_plan` depending on the desired scan type

## Usage

This infrastructure is deployed automatically using the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/terraform.yml`. The workflow provides complete CI/CD automation with security scanning, cost estimation, and infrastructure deployment.

### Automated Deployment Pipeline

The `terraform.yml` workflow includes the following automated stages:

#### 1. **Terraform Validation and Planning**
- **Terraform Format Check**: Ensures code follows canonical formatting
- **Terraform Validation**: Validates configuration syntax and logic
- **Terraform Plan**: Generates execution plan showing proposed changes
- **Plan Output**: Posts detailed plan as PR comment for review

#### 2. **Security and Cost Analysis**
- **Checkov Security Scan**: Runs in separate `code-scan.yml` workflow to identify security misconfigurations and compliance issues
- **Infracost Analysis**: Provides cost estimates for infrastructure changes
- **Cost Comparison**: Shows cost diff between current and proposed infrastructure

#### 3. **Automated Deployment**
- **Trigger**: Automatically deploys on pushes to `main` branch
- **Authentication**: Uses OIDC for secure, temporary AWS credentials
- **Terraform Apply**: Provisions infrastructure with GitHub App credentials
- **State Management**: Maintains Terraform state in remote backend

### Configuration Steps

Set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:
- `IAM_ROLE`: ARN of the OIDC-assumable IAM role
- `THIS_GITHUB_APP_ID`: GitHub App ID for runner authentication
- `THIS_GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID`: GitHub App Installation ID
- `THIS_GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY`: GitHub App private key
- `INFRACOST_API_KEY`: API key for cost estimation (optional)

### Monitoring and Validation

#### Deployment Status
- **Workflow Badge**: Click the terraform-infra-provisioning badge above for real-time status
- **GitHub Actions Logs**: Detailed logs available in the Actions tab
- **Terraform State**: Remote state tracks all deployed resources

#### Runner Validation
- **GitHub Organization**: Verify runners appear in Actions settings
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Monitor registration process in `/{name}/lifecycle` log group
- **Auto Scaling Group**: Check EC2 instances are launching successfully
- **EFS Mount**: Verify shared workspace storage is accessible

## Configuration

### Key Variables
The infrastructure can be customized by modifying the default values in `variables.tf`:

- `region`: AWS region for deployment (default: "us-west-2")
- `name`: Prefix for all resource names (default: "github-self-hosted-runner")
- `github_organization`: GitHub organization name (must be updated)
- `runner_instance_type`: EC2 instance type for runners (default: "t3.medium")
- `runner_min_size`: Minimum number of runners in Auto Scaling Group (default: 1)
- `runner_max_size`: Maximum number of runners in Auto Scaling Group (default: 3)
- `runner_desired_capacity`: Desired number of runners (default: 1)


## Security Considerations

- All runners operate in private subnets with no direct internet access
- GitHub App authentication provides scoped, time-limited access tokens
- All secrets are encrypted using customer-managed KMS keys
- CloudWatch logs are encrypted at rest with KMS
- EFS file system uses encryption in transit and at rest
- SNS topics and Lambda functions encrypted with customer-managed KMS keys
- Lambda functions run in VPC with private subnets for enhanced security
- Dead Letter Queue encrypted for secure error message handling
- Security groups restrict network access to necessary ports only
- IAM roles follow least privilege principle with minimal required permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Runners Not Appearing in GitHub
- Verify GitHub App permissions are correctly configured
- Check CloudWatch logs in `/{name}/lifecycle` log group for registration errors
- Ensure GitHub App credentials in Secrets Manager are valid
- Confirm the `github_organization` variable matches your GitHub organization name

#### EC2 Instances Failing to Launch
- Check Auto Scaling Group events in AWS Console
- Verify VPC and subnet configuration
- Ensure IAM roles have necessary permissions
- Check CloudWatch logs in `/{name}/lifecycle/{instance-id}/registration` log stream for detailed startup errors
- Review user data script execution in EC2 instance logs

#### Lambda Function Errors
- Check Lambda function logs in CloudWatch
- Verify Dead Letter Queue for failed invocations
- Ensure Lambda has network access to GitHub API
- Confirm GitHub App credentials are accessible from Lambda

#### Network Connectivity Issues
- Ensure NAT Gateway is properly configured for private subnet internet access
- Verify NFS security group rules for EFS mount targets
- Check lifecycle hook timeout configuration (5-minute default)
- Verify SNS topic permissions and Lambda subscription configuration

### Monitoring
- CloudWatch logs provide detailed lifecycle tracking with structured format
- Auto Scaling Group metrics show scaling activities and lifecycle hook status
- Lambda function metrics indicate deregistration success rates and error patterns
- Dead Letter Queue metrics show failed Lambda executions requiring investigation
- EFS performance metrics monitor storage throughput and connection counts
- SNS topic metrics track message delivery and failure rates
